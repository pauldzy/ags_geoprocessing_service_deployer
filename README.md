This script is the foundation of a more generic script to deploy ArcGIS Server 10.2.2 Geoprocessing Services via python.  Unlike my map service script, this one is far from generic as the script must do a dry run of each geoprocessing service to create the "results files" that then is deployed to the server.  How to abstract this script to something more generic remains under consideration.

One troublesome issue is the perplexing issue whereby the parameters used in the dry run of the geoprocessing service become the default parameters of the AGS gpservice.  It's difficult to envision a circumstance where this would ever be desirable.  In order to work around this bizarre deficiency, my toolboxes test if _ _ builtin _ _ .dz_deployer is true and if so then will run a default sample value with empty input parameters.  Its less than ideal as if you have a "dz_deployer" builtin already you have collisions but I am hopeful few others use a "dz" prefix for anything.
